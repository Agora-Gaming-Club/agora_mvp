        OR OFFER IS STRICTLY VOID AND OF NO EFFECT IN ANY STATE, COUNTRY, OR OTHER JURISDICTION THAT PROHIBITS,
        RESTRICTS, OR REQUIRES A LICENSE FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES. Notwithstanding any status as a paying participant, no

        understand that we may rely on your representation, you are registering for an Account, using the Platform, and
        the Services at your own sole discretion and assume all associated risk. You further acknowledge and understand
        that you are not relying on us for any warranty or other representation regarding your compliance with
        applicable law, and you further acknowledge and understand that no representative of ours has the ability or the
        authority to make such a representation. Your ability to download the Platform and use the Services in your
        location does not mean that your actives are legal and we make no representation that your ability to download
        the Platform and use the Services constitute any sort of legal compliance. Further, you agree to comply with our
        Anti-Harassment Policy and understand that any violation of our Anti-Harassment Policy may result in suspension,
        closure, or revocation of your Account, forfeiture of any funds and/or prizes, and other actions against you as
        may be permitted by applicable law. We retain the sole and final discretion to determine whether our

        payment methods. Upon confirmation of payment, your Account will be credited with the amount of money you have
        paid. You may use the money deposited solely for the payment of entry fees for applicable competitions. Entry
        fees are payable in U.S. dollars. All entry fees are deemed prepaid and are a prerequisite to your participation
        in any competition. All entry fees paid to enter a competition are final and you are not entitled to a refund of
        those entry fees for any reason. </p>

      <h3>J. Prizes.</h3>
      <p>The winners of various competitions may be awarded cash prizes. The amount of the cash prize is disclosed to
        the players and predetermined ahead of the start of each competition. Once a competition concludes, we will
        conduct an internal review to ensure fairness and technical soundness. Once our verification process concludes,
        and subject to our right to request additional information and these Terms, we will notify the winners and issue
        them their prizes via PayPal to the address that they have designated as part of their Account outcome

        review and verification process varies on a case-by-case basis, and shall be conducted in our sole discretion
        with no obligation or liability to you. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that the fairness or integrity
        of the competition was compromised, there was a technical issue, malfunction, or other problem that affected the
        outcome, we reserve the right to cancel the competition, cancel all prizes, and refund the entry fees to all
        participating players. Notwithstanding this provision, any violation of these Terms by you also permits us to

        ensuring a safe, sportsmanlike, and civil environment for all players, regardless of their race, ethnicity,
        gender, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic. Keep it fun, keep it friendly, and above all remember

      <p>You understand and agree that laws and regulations regarding payment of prizes, participation in competitions,

        fee competitions or receive any prizes from the following jurisdictions: Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, South
        Carolina, and South Dakota. (“Restricted Jurisdictions”). You agree that you will not access or play any
        real-money entry fee competitions or receive any prizes (or assist any other person in doing so) from a
        Restricted Jurisdiction. We do not make any representation or guarantee that your ability to access the Services
        or the Platform (or to pay entry fees or receive prizes) from outside the Restricted Jurisdictions complies with

        local laws and regulations to ensure that your activities related to the Services and the Platform comply with
        all those laws and regulations. Regardless whether the Software permits your access, you may not access the
        Services or participate in the Platform if doing so (or if receiving any prizes) will be a violation of any law
        or regulation.</p>
      <p></p>

        state, territory, or country) where it is not unlawful for you to access the Platform or the Services, and you
        may otherwise use the Services and play the Platform without violating any applicable federal, state, local, or

      <p></p>
      <h2>7. Dispute Resolution.</h2>
      <h3>A. General.</h3>
      <p>This Section 9 applies to any Dispute except for Disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of our
        intellectual property rights, which we may address through litigation or any other appropriate method without
        regard to this Section. The term “Dispute” means any dispute, action or other controversy between you and us
        concerning these Terms, the Services, the Platform, or any other product, service or information we make
        available to you, whether in contract, warranty, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance or any other legal or
        equitable basis. “Dispute” will be given the broadest possible meaning allowable under law. In the event of a
        Dispute, you or we must give the other a Notice of Dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the
        name, address and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, any
        supporting evidence (such as communications or screenshots), and the relief requested. You must send any Notice
        of Dispute by email to contact@agoragaming.gg. We will send any Notice of Dispute to you by U.S. Mail to your
        address if we have it, or otherwise to your email address, and you agree to receive any Notices of Dispute
        either by mail or email. The parties will strive to negotiate and attempt to resolve the dispute for a period of
        at least sixty (60) days (“Formal Complaint Process”). After the sixty (60) day period, either party may
        initiate arbitration as provided in this Section. You agree to use the Formal Complaint Process before
        initiating arbitration or any small claims case.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h3>B. Arbitration.</h3>
      <p>If the Dispute is not resolved through the Formal Complaint Process, you and we agree that any dispute arising
        out of or relating to this Agreement or our Services, including, without limitation, federal and state statutory
        claims, common law claims, and those based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal
        theory, shall be resolved through final binding arbitration, on an individual basis (the “Arbitration
        Agreement”). Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, you may elect to pursue your claim in your local
        small claims court rather than through arbitration so long as your matter remains in small claims court and
        proceeds only on an individual (non-class and non-representative) basis. Arbitration shall be conducted in
        accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes
        (accessible at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf).This Arbitration Agreement
        includes, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the
        Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration
        Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement. All such matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and
        not by a court or judge.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h3>C. Procedure.</h3>
      <p>The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and shall take place in the State of New
        York, telephonically, or remotely, or another mutually agreeable location, in the English language. The
        arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award and the arbitral decision may
        be enforced in any court. An arbitrator’s decision and judgment thereon will not have a precedential or
        collateral estoppel effect. Hearings may be conducted remotely (by phone or video conferencing software) and the
        arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral argument.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h3>D. CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</h3>
      <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN A PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT
        AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING
        (COLLECTIVELY “CLASS ACTION WAIVER”). THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS OR ENGAGE
        IN ANY CLASS ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AND WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE
        RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h3>E. Attorney’s Fees and Costs.</h3>
      <p>In any Dispute, each party shall bear its own attorney fees and any related costs incurred as part of the
        Dispute Resolutions Process in this Section.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>8. Copyright, DMCA, and Other Intellectual Property Complaints.</h2>
      <h3>A. General.</h3>
      <p>We respect the intellectual property of others and expect our users and players to do the same. If you believe
        that there has been a violation of your copyright, trademark, or any other intellectual property rights, please
        contact us at contact@agoragaming.gg.</p>

      <p></p>
      <h3>D. Assignment.</h3>
      <p>We may assign these Terms at our discretion, in whole or in part, at any time without any notice to you. You
        may not assign these Terms or any license given to you by us in relation to the Terms.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h3>E. Privacy Policy.</h3>
      <p>These Terms incorporate our Privacy Policy, as if the Privacy Policy were set forth in its entirety here. The
        Privacy Policy explains the policies put in place and used by us to protect your privacy as you play the
        Platform or otherwise use our Services. We receive, store and use all information that you submit to us and all
        information you submit in registering for an Account and using the Platform, in accordance with the Privacy
        Policy, so please read it carefully. Like these Terms, the Privacy Policy may change from time to time, and your
        continued access to your Account, use of the Services and the Platform indicates your acceptance of the Privacy
        Policy as amended, and thus it is important for you to periodically access and review the Privacy Policy.</p>
